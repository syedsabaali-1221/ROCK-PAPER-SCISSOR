# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR

A responsive and interactive Rock Paper Scissors web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates my front-end development skills, game logic implementation, and DOM manipulation.

 Project Description:
This web-based Rock Paper Scissors game allows users to play against the computer in real time.
The computer randomly selects its move, compares it with the user’s choice, and instantly displays the result.

It focuses on:

Clean UI design,
Logical condition handling,
Smooth user interaction.

🚀 Features of my project:

 - User vs Computer gameplay,
-  Random computer move generation,
- Instant result display (Win / Lose / Draw),
- Score tracking system,
- Responsive and user-friendly interface,
- Fast performance without external libraries.

tecnologies used here:

HTML	Structure of the game interface,
CSS	Styling and responsive layout,
JavaScript	Game logic, randomization, and DOM manipulation.


How It Works:

User selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors,
Computer randomly chooses its move,
Game logic compares both choices,
Result is displayed instantly on the screen,
Scores are updated dynamically.
